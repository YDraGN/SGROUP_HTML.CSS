          <h1> This is a motherfucking website. </h1>
          <p> And it's fucking perfect.</p>
          <h2> Seriously, what the fuck else do you want? </h2>
          <p> You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home
               page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You
               think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow.
               Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
          <ul>
               <li> Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
               <li> Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
               <li> Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
               <li> The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
               <li> Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3> Well guess what, motherfucker</h3>
          <p> You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking websit. Why the 
               fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flase when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.

               You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.
          </p>
          <h2>
               It's fucking lightweight
          </h2>
          <p>
               This entire page weighs less than gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div?
          </p>
          <h2>
               It's responsive
          </h2>
          <p>
               You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screenize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagochi.
          </p>
          <h2>
               It fucking works
          </h2>
          <p>
               Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Animi possimus earum soluta iste. Sint ducimus impedit et sequi dolorum quam iusto, reiciendis distinctio fuga corporis itaque, maiores, perferendis incidunt nisi?
          </p>
          <h2> This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
          <p>
               Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Fuga consectetur sed exercitationem magnam delectus veniam voluptatum iusto facilis recusandae adipisci a cum suscipit facere omnis eligendi iure minus, ab modi?
          </p>
          <h3> Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
          <p> 
               Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Obcaecati temporibus <b>at vitae incidunt aut</b>. Iure natus nesciunt sunt sit vero earum facere atque. Commodi quia ullam quasi eveniet tempora optio!
