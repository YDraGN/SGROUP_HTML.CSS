     <h2>
          Styling?
     </h2>
     <p>
          You probaly build website using vim and you think that's harcore. You think your 4.99KB <span
               style="color: rgb(147, 1, 1)">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some award to put on
          on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
     </p>
     <p>
          Well, guess what, you're <span
               style="color: rgb(212, 37, 37); text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase;">wrong</span>,
          motherfucker.
     </p>
     <h2>
          The best kick-ass website
     </h2>
     <p>
          Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past
          <span style="color: rgb(147, 1, 1)">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:
     <ul>
          <li>
               Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)
          </li>
          <li>
               The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google home
                    page</a>
          </li>
          <li>
               Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagochi, I'm sorry)
          </li>
          <li>
               Look <i>almost</i> the same on every screen
          </li>
          <li>
               Every asshole that visists this website can use it without any problem <span class="small-text">well,
                    kind of</span>
          </li>
          <li>
               It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span
                    class="small-text">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span>
          </li>
          <li>
               Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish
               style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website
          </li>
          <li>
               Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a>
          </li>
          <li>
               Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font calls "Open Sans" <span
                    class="small-text">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</span>
          </li>
          <li>
               It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fuckingg styles and shits. Nor Angular or
               any other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
          </li>
          <li>
               Doesn't include any tracking service
          </li>
          <li>
               Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT.</i>
          </li>
          <li>
               Use <i>some</i> fucking <span>colors</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
               Links don't really need to keep that <span class="not-allowed" style="color: blue;">shitty blue</span>
               the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="not-allowed" style="color: rgb(70, 14, 142)">violetish
                    color</span> when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a
                    href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a>
          </li>
     </ul>
     </p>
     <h2>
          Well guess what, motherfucker:
     </h2>
     <p>
          This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy</a> and the <a
               href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him.</a>
     </p>
     <p>
          Why?
     <ul>
          <li>
               It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what
               we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).
          </li>
          <li>
               It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out
               there: .website
          </li>
          <li>
               It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="http://domainr.com/">domainr</a>
               to do something cool too.
          </li>
          <li>
               It uses the kickass <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous
               lock?)
          </li>
          <li>
               It uses <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js">a custom version</a> of the
               awesome <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery.</a> <b>/s</b>
          </li>
          <li>
               It probaly doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is
               outdated they will notice and maybe they will switch from <a
                    href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/internet-explorer-help-23360e49-9cd3-4dda-ba52-705336cc0de2">the
                    crap they use</a> to <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox">a much cooler browser</a>
          </li>
          <li>
               It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <i class="fa-brands fa-js" style="color: #FFD43B"></i>,
               CSS3 <i class="fa-brands fa-css3-alt" style="color: #1970b3;"></i> and HTML5 <i
                    class="fa-brands fa-html5" style="color: #f06c33;"></i>
          </li>
          <li>
               Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the website doesn't need to have JS enable
               to be properly rendered
          </li>
          <li>
               It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>
          </li>
          <li>
               It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website
               more than once
          </li>
          <li>
               It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a>
          </li>
          <li>
               It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Accessible</a>
          </li>
          <li>
               It hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, making it <a
                    href="https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/website/">almost free</a> to keep this
               website alive
          </li>
          <li>
               It's Open Source, freely available on <a
                    href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">GitHub</a>, and everybody can
               contribute to it.
          </li>
          <li>
               It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>,
               which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
               <p class="WTFPL">
                    0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

     <h2>
          Put even less contrast

     <p>
          Yeah, a
          <span class="four-before"></span>
          <span class="four">#444 is cool</span>
          but a

     <h2>
          Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate
     </h2>
     <p>
          Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches
          screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.

                    a little bit of context, or to cheer up the reader. Do you really like to waste the power of
                    technology that we have nowadays? Come on, you're using a web browser on a computer, you're not
                    reading a book on a Kindle.
               </p>
               <p>
                    The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading
                    your nonsense words.

          But this doesn't mean you should load your motherfuckingwebsite with shitty animations. Keep it simple, minify
          its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users, less requests (with a small size) = faster
          load time! Oh and by the way, this doesn't mean that you should use webpack and put everything in a 10MB
          main.js file, there are people out there who are still using 56k modems and haven't tried <a

          Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite</a> and the
          <a href="">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>. Despite the criticism here, they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on
          the internet (even though this is still <span style="color: rgb(147, 1, 1)">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite.</span>), so go check 'em out. Nevertheless, this
          shows that the internet has taken a really wrong turn - I honestly miss the time when websites were made to
          convey information. At least, thanks god, we got rid of pop-ups.

          Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again"
